File.IO is good for premitive data type and small little operations

when you have a class / object which may have 30 properties


we have a concept - Serialization for object

	Store whole object in 1 go
	read whole object in 1 go



		object ====> File ----- Serialization
		File  =====> object ---- DeSeralization

Persist the state of an object to storage so that it can be recreated as it was = Serialization
recraete the object which was stored back into memory = DeSerialization

ObjectOutputStream -- from ram to file - for serialization
ObjectInputStream -- from file to ram - for deserialization
