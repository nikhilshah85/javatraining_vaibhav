					Angular 

		This is a Advance Javascript framework based on EcmaScript implementation 
				OOPS based javascript


			This is a framework from Google

			There was AngularJS - from google only - based on MVC design pattern - suitable for 			small applictions - 1.7 was the last version 

			Further, to make it available for enterprise applications - big size app development
			they brought 2.0 - based on Component based development
			2.0 -- 4.0 -- 6.0 -- 7 --8 --10 --11 --12 --13 version --16


			Ecma Script - is OOPS based Javascript - and all the browsers supports Javascript

			But ECMA script is difficult to implment - everything is function based 
				it was very difficult to develop apps 

			Microsoft jumped in - understood ECMA standards - created compilers - modules(packages)
					keywords, etcc.. and called it as TypeScript (language)
			google uses typescript to develop components in Angular





			This is an opensource - free to devlop and use - available on ALL OS - cross platform
