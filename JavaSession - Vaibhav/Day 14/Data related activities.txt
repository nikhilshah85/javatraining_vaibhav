1. Hard coded data - can perform CRUD on this data  - once you restart the server all the data is gone
	use data structures for ease 
2. Use XML Files, JSON file, excel files, CSV files for the same
	performance 
	files cannot store huge amount of data
	files are slow in filter, sort, updates etc...you do not SQL support here
3. Database - this is the end solution
	SQL Server Express - free - upto 5 GB of data
		after a year when 5GB is not enough, you want more data
		Thus a higher version will need a licence (COST)
	Oracle is offerering licence at a very low cost - lets go with this


	later switch to mongoDB (30x faster than RDBMS) - Made and designed for JSON - use for REST API 
	use MongoDB to support more clients, better performance

4. We also want a database to be in Memory - perform CRUD operations in memory whole day and update the database end of the day, end of the user session etc... as per our need

	All of this can be resolved
