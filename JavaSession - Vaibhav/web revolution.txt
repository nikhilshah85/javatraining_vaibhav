						Web Revolution (since 2015-17)

	1. When did you use internet first time - 2010 - (world average - 2007)
	2. What did you use internet for - Study, Surfing etc...
	3. Where did you use internet those days - Home / Cyber / Office
	4. How did you use internet - Desktop - Laptop
	5. Source of internet - Broadband - LAN - Wifi (static speed)
	
	Thus developer will develop contents accordingly

		This was same till around 2014-15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	New users today and also old users 
	
	-- How did you use internet - Mobile Phones/Tablets/Devises Desktop - Laptop

			11:30PM - ola - it was takeing time to show the cab, to enter destination

		2 Things 
			1. ola lost the revenue - their driverr also lost the revenu
			2. they lost to competition 
			3. they lost the customer/user
			4. right now and since 2018 - loosing the brand name

	-- Thus a shift in userr expericence into a different world is called as WebRevolution

		--Server side development tech  - servelets - EJB etc...
			has been moved to client side development (client centric)
		-- Spring Boot, Angular, Node, glass fish etc...
		-- Data and data format (XML) - WebServices - is the reason for Y2K - 2004-2005
				this was the best technology and inovation till 2014

				but now, XML is very heavy for network 

		--thus we need a light weight format to exchange the data - JSON 

			XML
			<temperature>
				<x:number>35</x:number>
			</temperature>

			JSON
			{
				temperature:35
			}
			this is considered 200% ligher, faster that xml - 
			REST ful api - is a standard way to develop the data excange platform


	-- SPA app - (Single paged application) - 
					Spring Boot for the web app (server related work) (Backend)
					REST API - (Middleware)
					Angular allows us to create SPA apps
