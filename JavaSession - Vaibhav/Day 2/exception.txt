Error : development time
Exception : runtime

we should always write code in a snippet

try
{

	//try to run this code, expecting everyhting will be as planned

}
catch(exception details)
{
	//tell user what went wrong
	//this will not crash the application, and developer has a option to restart the applcation from where it halted
}
finally
{
	//netural block, will always executed, even in case there is an exception
}
