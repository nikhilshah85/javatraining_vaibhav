			OOPS - 4 Pillars

	a. Abstraction
	b. Encapsulation
	c. Inheritance
	d. Polymprphism

		created objects
		constructor
		methods - encapsulation
		condition - if and loop
		user interaction

		problem
		object created last week is gone

		initial balance - 1500
			deposit(6000)
			widraw(4000)
			

---- We need to store the data
		data can be stored in a file - .txt, .dat and then encrypt it etc..
			for small applications we start with filesystem (this does not cost)

		when application grows, data grows, users grows, --- shift to database - cost 

		FileSystem - FileIO

		application has to go to OS, ask for stram, connect to HDD, get address - lot of things

		instead, what we have in Java, everything is pre-written for us
		We have been given a ready made code - set of classes, methods, propertoes which does all this 
		for you - API
